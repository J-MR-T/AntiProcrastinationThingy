# Archived

I am not currently working on advancing APT any further and do not have plans to do so. At the time of first writing APT I didn't know any low-level languages, was a Windows user and had just discorvered the Java 9 Process API, so I decided to implement my idea in Java and later to transition to Kotlin. If I would code APT today from scratch, I would use a language more geared towards systems programming, but now that I'm on linux, I have resorted to simply doing this:
```bash
nohup $(while true; do killall discord; sleep 1; done)
```
and then closing the terminal, whenever I'm in need of something to stop me from distracting myself.
